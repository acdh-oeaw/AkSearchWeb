; Patron login method to use. The following options are available:
; vufind    Use VuFind's user database for authentication -- patrons are retrieved
;           from Alma without a password (default). This is only useful when
;           VuFind is set up to use AlmaDatabase authentication in config.ini. In any
;           other setting it would allow login without proper password.
; password  Use password authentication with Alma internal users. This method is
;           supported with the normal ILS and MultiILS authentication methods in
;           VuFind. Note that it will not work with external users in Alma since they
;           don't have a password in Alma.
; email     Username needs to be a valid email address or other unique identifier for
;           the user. An authentication link is sent by email to user's preferred
;           email address registered in Alma. This method can be used with both
;           internal and external Alma users and it is supported with the normal ILS
;           and MultiILS authentication methods in VuFind.

; To use a separate Alma text domain:
; translationPrefix = "Alma::"
;translationPrefix = "Alma::"
